JWChat - Jabber Web Chat
========================

JWChat aims to be a full featured, web based jabber client. It uses
only JavaScript and HTML on the client-side. Currently it supports
basic jabber instant messaging, roster management and muc-based
groupchats.

If you want to learn more about Jabber please refer to
http://www.jabber.org.

JWChat is a web based instant messenger (IM) just like AIM, MSN
Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger or ICQ. This means you can manage your
contacts and chat with other users directly. Unlike other IMs you can
use this with your web browser without having to install any
additional software at all. For a list of supported browsers see
below. Your contact list is stored on the server. This means that you
have access to your contact list from almost any computer as long as
you've got access to the internet.

Requirements
============

You need to have access to a jabber server by way of either [1]HTTP Polling
or [2]HTTP Binding. Either use some server that has support for one of these
protocols biult in (e.g. [3]ejabberd) or use some gateway like [4]punjab 
(python based) or [5]JabberHTTPBind (a java servlet).

[2]http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0124.html
[3]http://ejabberd.jabber.ru
[4]http://punjab.sourceforge.net
[5]http://zeank.in-berlin.de/jhb/

Additionally you need a web-server of your choice capable
of doing address rewriting.

Download
========

Please refer to http://jwchat.sourceforge.net/download.shtml for
download instructions.

Quick Install Guide
===================

* If you attained JWChat by checking it out via CVS, be sure to also
  read README.CVS in the top-level directory.

* Unpack jwchat into some directory that is accessible by your web
  server. E.g.: /var/www/jwchat

* Setup your web server so that it redirects some local address like
  http://jabber.example.com/http-poll/ to some service that either
  implements HTTP Polling or HTTP Binding.

  Some servers like ejabberd do have such a service built-in. Please
  refer to the docs of your jabber server to find out how to use it.

  If your server does not have such a service built-in or you don't
  plan to run your own jabber server at all there are standalone
  components like punjab or JabberHTTPBind available that let you
  connect to any jabber server using HTTP Binding or HTTP Polling.

  Here is an example that should work with a default ejabberd
  installation on the same host:

%<-----<schnipp>-----
<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName jabber.example.com
  DocumentRoot /var/www/jwchat
  <Directory /var/www/jwchat>
    Options  +Indexes +MultiViews
  </Directory>
  AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule http-poll/ http://127.0.0.1:5280/http-poll/ [P]
</VirtualHost>
%<-----<schnapp>-----

  Alternatively you could put a .htaccess file within jwchat's
  subdirectory like this (you need to have 'AllowOverride All' in your
  apache config in order to make this work):

%<-----<schnipp>-----
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule http-poll/ http://127.0.0.1:5280/http-poll/ [P]
</IfModule>
%<-----<schnapp>-----

  Note 1: You need to enable mod_rewrite and mod_proxy at your apache
  configuration. Apache2 users also need to enable the protocol
  specific proxy module mod_proxy_http.

  Note 2: With JabberHTTPBind you don't need to do this sort of
  address rewriting if you're serving JWChat's files from within your
  servlet container directly or you're using some technique like
  mod_jk to mount a remote servlet engine directory transparently into
  your apache's domain of served addresses.

  Note to FreeBSD users: Please add 'WITH_PROXY_MODULES=true' to your 
  /etc/make.conf before installing apache!

* Restart your web server.

* Test if this redirect works. Following the example above point your
  browser to http://jabber.example.com/http-poll/. You should see the
  same response as if you you're pointing it to
  http://jabber.example.com:5280/http-poll/.

* Edit 'config.js' to suit your needs.
  Be sure to set 'httpbase' to the redirected address from
  above. Within our example it would have to be
  'http://jabber.example.com/http-poll/' or 'http-poll/' in short.
  
  Note 1: Double check this if using some relative address (relative to
  jwchat's base URL).

  Note 2: You can't use an httpbase address that is not local to your
  JWChat installation. Local in this context means that it MAY NOT be
  on some different host or port then where JWChat is being served from.

* If you haven't done yet start your jabber server (if any).

* Point your browser to http://jabber.example.com and log in.
